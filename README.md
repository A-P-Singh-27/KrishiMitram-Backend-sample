# KrishiMitram Backend (Public Demo)

This repository contains a **sanitized, backend-only version** of KrishiMitram,
originally developed as a **team project for Smart India Hackathon 2025**.

The code is made public **solely for internship evaluation purposes**
to demonstrate backend development skills such as REST API design,
authentication, authorization, and MongoDB schema modeling.

Sensitive data, credentials, frontend code, and team-owned components
have been intentionally removed.

> Note: This is not the complete production codebase.
